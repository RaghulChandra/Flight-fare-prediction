# Flight Price Prediction with deployment

### I have built a simple web app model which predicts the price of flight given the departure time , arrival time , date of journey , airline etc !

### This project aims to develop an application which will predict the flight prices for various flights using machine learning model. The user will get the predicted values and with its reference the user can decide to book their tickets accordingly.
### This was a fun project as the dataset which I had was categorical and to convert that into meaningful and mapping numerical values took me some time !
### I have also included the dataset (air_train.xlsx and air_test.xlsx) , the jupyter notebook(main code) file and the pickle file !


### Frontend and Backend -- Streamlit
